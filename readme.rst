General Scala utilities
--------------------------

kadai is a collection of general utility classes that are helpful when starting
a new Scala project. These have been derived from a number of projects that were
repeating essentially the same code.

Architecture
------------
The code is separated into fairly specific purpose modules, each with as few dependencies as possible.

The modules are:

:core:
    basic data structures for disjunction result types with Invalids holding errors or error messages
    on the left and and utilities for turning exceptions into Invalid results
:concurrent:
    commonly useful concurrency primitives
:config:
    simple Scala interface to the typesafe-config library with a Reader monad for composing 
    configurable things and injecting configuration files.
:cmdopts:
    simple and type-safe Command Line Option parser
:logging:
    lightweight Scala friendly logging library
